# Amazon-Website-Clone-FrontEnd
This project is a frontend clone of the Amazon website, created using HTML and CSS. It replicates the look and feel of Amazon's interface, focusing on layout, styling, and responsiveness. Key features include the homepage, product listings, and navigation. This project serves as a practice to enhance my web development skills.
